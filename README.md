# jenkins-ops-buttons
I created this repo to add a very short and simple example because many people often asking me why to use **Jenkins** and no **CircleCI**, **GitLab CI**, **TravisCI** or another CI tool?

Jenkins is not just for CI/CD pipelines. You can easily attach Ops buttons with actions as well:

Also, it is an open source project you can customized a lot and use it as multi purpose tool in a much lower cost or hosted in a private network for **security reasons**.

You can east try it with ```docker run -it --rm --name jenkins -p 8081:8080 jenkins/jenkins:lts```
